A great wiki is in progress which will have all the details of every know things that this package is capable of.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nAdd `sunel/laravel-layout` as a requirement to composer.json:\r\n\r\nhttps://packagist.org/packages/sunel/laravel-layout\r\n \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"require\": {\r\n    \"sunel/laravel-layout\": \"dev-develop\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate your packages with `composer update` or install with `composer install`.\r\n\r\nIn *app/config/app.php* add:\r\n\r\n `'Layout\\Provider\\LayoutServiceProvider',`\r\n \r\nto providers \r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nPull the configuration file into your application by running the following artisan command\r\n```php\r\n$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Layout\\Provider\\LayoutServiceProvider\" --tag=config\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create config file \"layout.php\" which will have the all the configuration required.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Will add the usage details of the config variables \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n####The basic concept of this package:\r\n\r\n- Every page has a common structure which is defined through a layout XML Files. \r\n- A Layout is a collection of blocks in a tree structure.\r\n- Each layout is a list of instruction on how a page must render what it must render and which Block(s) should kick off the rendering process.\r\n- So basically all section in the layout are called View.\r\n- Each View has a  BLOCK which is a php class and a TEMPLATE file which are tied to each other.\r\n- Blocks are independent components which can have there own data model called within itself.\r\n- This provides ultimate flexibility and re-usability of design.\r\n\r\n####So how does this works :\r\n\r\n> **Note:**  This package assumes that every router has name **(ROUTER NAME)** for it.\r\n\r\nAs said before every page has common layout in a XML file, you can find the files in the layout folder.\r\nTo move the files to your application run the following artisan command\r\n```php\r\n$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Layout\\Provider\\LayoutServiceProvider\" --tag=layout\r\n```\r\nThis will move the sample layout xml files into \"resources/layout/layout\" folder.\r\n\r\nThis command will export basic css for a page layout\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Layout\\Provider\\LayoutServiceProvider\" --tag=public\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis package already provides the default structure for a every page which will in the **default.xml** [here][1].\r\n\r\n> **Note:**  For this example we are going to use a page which has layout with 3 columns [here][2]\r\n\r\nThe root element of any layout XML file is ```<layout>```.\r\n\r\n####Layout Handles\r\n\r\nIn these XML files, you will see a number of snippets of XML enclosed in layout handle parent nodes, which are used to determine the type of page being displayed.\r\n\r\nThe ```<default>``` handle is the one that loads most of the pages and forms the base or to say skeleton of every page. So most of the case we use the one given in the page without modifying it.\r\n\r\nThe   ```<default>``` handle almost has all the required section in a page.Basically it like having a placeholder for every section. we need to define what content should be loaded for each request.\r\n\r\nSo how to that ??\r\n\r\n> Lets assume we are requesting for home page of the application which has the name **\"home\"**\r\n```php\r\nRoute::get('/',['as'=>'home',function(){\t\r\n\treturn render();\t\r\n}]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nVery simple just create a new xml file with any name and add the below snippet\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<layout version=\"0.1.0\">\r\n\t<home>\r\n\t\t<reference name=\"content\">\r\n            <block class=\"\\Layout\\Page\\Html\" name=\"home\" template=\"render::home\">\r\n            </block>\r\n        </reference>\r\n    \t<reference name=\"left\">\r\n            <block class=\"\\Layout\\Page\\Html\" name=\"home.left\" template=\"render::left\">\r\n            </block>\r\n        </reference>\r\n        <reference name=\"right\">\r\n            <block class=\"\\Layout\\Page\\Html\" name=\"home.right\" template=\"render::right\">\r\n            </block>\r\n        </reference>\r\n\t</home>\r\n</layout>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote ```<home>``` this is the handle that loades the content for the page , to say it fills the placeholders which is defined in the **default** handle\r\n\r\nNow in the layout config file replace the **'xml_location'** to the \r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\n'xml_location' => [\r\n    __DIR__.'/../resources/layout/layout'\r\n],\r\n\r\n```\r\n> **Note** You can also add multiple xml file location\r\n\r\nNow when request for the router with the name **'home'**\r\n\r\n**That's it you will see a fully render page**\r\n\r\n###Rendering Process\r\n\r\nBefore rendering the page, all block elements defined in the layout are instantiated. Nested block elements define child blocks. If any block element defines an output attribute, then it is considered as an output block. Only the output blocks are rendered and added to the response. All other child blocks are rendered only if they are called by the parent block. Let’s see how this works.\r\n\r\nThe block root is defined as an output block. This block is defined in the **default.xml** file. With the particular value of the template attribute, this block defines the page template to be used when rendering it, \r\n\r\ni.e:\r\n\r\n- 1 column\r\n- 2 columns with left sidebar \r\n- 2 columns with right sidebar \r\n- 3 columns \r\n\r\nBy default, the 3 columns template is assigned to the page. There are also other child blocks defined under root like **head, header, breadcrumbs, left, right, content, footer etc**. These child blocks are rendered in the root template file (3columns.blade.php) by calling something like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n{!! $_this->getChildHtml('header') !!}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn any template, the child blocks can be rendered by calling the getChildHtml() method as above and passing the child block name as the first argument. If the method is called without arguments, it will render all child blocks of the current block that are defined in the layout XML for that block.\r\n\r\nHence, Layout processes layout using a recursive rendering process. First the root block then its child blocks and then the child’s child blocks and so on.\r\n\r\n##What is ??\r\n\r\n``` class=\"\\Layout\\Page\\Html\" ```\r\n\r\n\r\nIts is the block class that view uses to tie with the template it is extened from ```\\Layout\\Block``` class which is base abstract class for a block . you can use as it is or extent the class and add custom function that can be called inside the template file or used to get data from any model.\r\n\r\n###Layout Elements\r\n\r\nA layout handle may contain the following elements:\r\n\r\n**block:** This element is used to define a new block. This element is usually defined inside a reference element when we want to create a new block. The block element must have a name attribute, which is a unique identifier of the block in the layout and a type attribute, which defines the block class name. If the block is of type or subtype of core/template, it can also have the template attribute which defines the actual phtml template file to be used for rendering the block\r\n\r\n**reference:** This element is used to link an already defined block in any layout XML. To add any child block to an existing block, to modify attributes of an existing block or to perform any action on an existing block, the reference element is used to link to the existing block. The reference element must have a name attribute which refers to the existing block’s name.\r\n\r\n**remove:** This element is used to remove an existing block from the layout. The block to be removed is specified with the name attribute.\r\n\r\n**action:** This element defines an action to be performed on the referenced or newly defined block. An action is simply a method of the block instance on which it is to be executed. The method attribute defines the method name in the block instance and all child elements of the action element are treated as parameters to the method. This element can be placed inside reference or block elements.\r\n\r\n**update:** This element loads an existing layout handle into the current layout handle. It provides a kind of inheritance of layout handles. It must have the handle attribute, which defines the handle of the block to be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Caching\r\n\r\nThis package supports caching out of the box.\r\n\r\n Add cache lifetime to the block class and provide the cache id. You also set the cache group and tag through CONSTANTS so that they can be cleared using it.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Cache group Tag.\r\n     */\r\n    const CACHE_GROUP = 'block_html';\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Cache tags data key.\r\n     */\r\n    const CACHE_TAGS_DATA_KEY = 'cache_tags';\r\n\r\n    public function _construct()\r\n    {\r\n        $this->addData([\r\n            'cache_lifetime' => Carbon::now()->addMinutes(10),\r\n        ]);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Retrieve cache key data.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return array\r\n     */\r\n    public function getCacheKeyInfo()\r\n    {\r\n        $cacheId = [\r\n            'SOMEUNIQUEID',\r\n            $this->getNameInLayout(),\r\n        ];\r\n\r\n        return $cacheId;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n* Adding Top Menus\r\n    \r\nYou can added Top menus dynamicaly by listening to event **page.block.html.topmenu.getMenus.before**.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\n    Event::listen('page.block.html.topmenu.getMenus.before', function ($menu, $block) {\r\n        $menu->add('Men', 'menu');\r\n        $menu->add('Women', 'women');\r\n    });\r\n\r\n```\r\nIt uses the popular package [lavary/laravel-menu](https://github.com/lavary/laravel-menu) for menus.\r\n\r\n* Adding Top Links\r\n\r\nYou can add links by referencing the block **top.links**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<home>\r\n    <reference name=\"top.links\">\r\n        <action method=\"addLink\" translate=\"label title\">\r\n            <label>My Account</label>\r\n            <url helper=\"\\Layout\\Page\\Html@getAccountUrl\"/>\r\n            <title>My Account</title>\r\n            <prepare/>\r\n            <urlParams/>\r\n            <position>1</position>\r\n        </action>\r\n        <action method=\"addLink\" translate=\"label title\">\r\n            <label>Register</label>\r\n            <url>/auth/register</url>\r\n            <title>Register</title>\r\n            <prepare/>\r\n            <urlParams/>\r\n            <position>2</position>\r\n         </action>\r\n         <action method=\"addLink\" translate=\"label title\">\r\n            <label>About</label>\r\n            <url>about</url>\r\n            <title>About</title>\r\n            <prepare>true</prepare>\r\n            <urlParams>\r\n                <id>bar</id>\r\n                <foo>bar</foo>\r\n            </urlParams>\r\n            <position>3</position>\r\n            <liParams>\r\n                <id>bar</id>\r\n                <foo>bar</foo>\r\n            </liParams>\r\n            <aParams>\r\n                <id>bar</id>\r\n                <foo>bar</foo>\r\n            </aParams>\r\n         </action>\r\n    </reference>\r\n</home>\r\n\r\n```\r\n* MultipleHandles\r\n\r\nThis allows developers to target their layout updates to multiple layout handles at once.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <home ifhandle=\"customer_logged_in\">\r\n        <reference name=\"content\">\r\n            ...\r\n        </reference>\r\n    </home>\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]:https://github.com/sunel/laravel-layout/blob/develop/layout/default.xml\r\n  [2]: https://photos-3.dropbox.com/t/2/AAA4hiywutlrZrckIqwWzzfA49JehTqpghXAse1kl6S9kg/12/93078715/png/32x32/1/1432735200/0/2/3lc.png/CLuJsSwgASACIAMgBCAFIAYgBygB/SU_wk5eoHQPT-5ISy334QjMS8x-7hZy75CEzG98c3k4?size_mode=5\r\n","google":"UA-28215321-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
